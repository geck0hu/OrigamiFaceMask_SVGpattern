Multi-level SVG to PDF conversion with scriptable scaling mechanisms
====================================================================

Thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic, the need to develop home-made masks are high.

One of the benefits of D.I.Y. is the tailoring of the product to its user. The essentials of SVG provides great platform to create any sizes of patterns.

This script doesn't intend to provide high flexibility. Variables are all burnt into the script, arguments/parameters are not utilised (yet). The main goal was to make the production of documents as automated as possible in case the main SVG document is modified, updated.
